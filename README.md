**`A Cybersecurity enthusiast who loves tech`**

I'm a student at Western Governors University studying Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I have hands-on experience through many projects and my home lab, which I use daily to continue sharpening my skills and improving. I'm a Leader, a quick learner, and a team player, so I get along with people very well.

## Experience:

- Created a home lab for self-hosting and learning new software.
- Assisted friends & family with technical issues.
- Set up remote access via VPN to avoid port forwarding.
- Troubleshot software and devices.
- Built computers and set up workstations.
- Reimaged computers and debloated Windows.
- Undervolted hardware (CPU/GPU) for better performance.
- Updated older devices and their drivers to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Windows/Linux administration via PowerShell/Bash commands


## Projects:

### 1. Home Lab

  I started with a Raspberry Pi 5 and learned a lot about Linux and how to use the terminal. Everything from navigating the terminal to file or user management. I know the different package managers and Linux distros, the importance of self-hosting services for privacy, and useful tools for exploiting vulnerabilities in other devices, like nmap. 

### 2. Linux Administration

  I spent a lot of time practicing Linux commands, doing things like permission management, creating files and directories, adding or deleting users, updating and installing new software.

### 3. Wazuah SIEM

  Setting up a Wazuah SIEM to monitor and log devices.
