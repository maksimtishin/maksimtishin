I'm a student at Western Governors University studying Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I have hands-on experience through many projects and my home lab, which I use daily to continue sharpening my skills and improving. I'm a Leader, a quick learner, and a team player, so I get along with people very well.

- Undervolted hardware (CPU/GPU) for better performance.
- Updated older devices and their drivers to mitigate vulnerabilities.
