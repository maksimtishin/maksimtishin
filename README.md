# 🏄 Maksim Tishin

**`A Cybersecurity enthusiast who loves tech`**

I'm a student at Western Governors University studying Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I have hands-on experience through many projects and my home lab, which I use daily to continue sharpening my skills and improving. I'm a Leader, a quick learner, and a team player, so I get along with people very well.
